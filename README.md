# U2R-Attack
Here I have taken KDD Dataset for detecting U2R attack. This dataset consist of all the datas that are related to the DOS, U2R and etc.
First, We need to perform data pre-processing in order to remove null and duplicate values from the dataset
Next, We need to analysis F-Dataset in order to understand what kind of data our dataset contains.
Later need to extract features from the dataset because this dataset contains data for all attacks since we need to predict only U2R attack so  split the Data feaures into trinng and testing set in the aspect of 70:30 
Load training Data into classification algorithm in order to inialize the training process then need to test model with test data in order to get efficiency
Based on that test result Model Accuracy is evaluated and the graph is plotted.

now run urself bro will check then will explain what i have done it in code
 bro how do u open jupyter
go to coder then type cmd in addess bar l
k bro this is how u have to run rest of the codes

here i have taken kdd dataset for detecting u2r attack
this dataset consist of all the datas that r relatedt to the ddos ,u2r and etc..


afterer that we need to perform data preprocessing in orderto remove null and duplicate values from the datasset 

after that we need to analysis fdataset in order to understand what kind of dta our dtaset contains

later need to extract features from the dataset because this dataset contains data for all attacks here we need to predict only u2r attack

tehn nedd to split that feaures into trinng and testing set this will 70:30 aspect


then we need to load training data into classification algorithm in order to nialize the trianing process


then need to test model with test data in order to get efficiency

based on that test result only we were evaluating our model accuracy

thats the accuracy graph ploted in our code

k bro ths same for all codes except algorithms


k
any doubt 

once check dataset also k
 
k bro  
will the code only run on jupyter or can we use idle or pylab?
jupyter notebook because i installed packages locally
k bro
shall i leave
s bro thank u
